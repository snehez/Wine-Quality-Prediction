# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction
📷 Project Cover: ![Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/snehez/Wine-Quality-Prediction/blob/main/Wine%20Quality%20Prediction.png)
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its physicochemical characteristics using machine learning techniques. It applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification models to build a predictive system for wine quality.


## 📂 Dataset

- **Name:** Wine Quality Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **File Used:** `WineQT.csv`
- The dataset includes features such as alcohol content, pH, sulphates, citric acid, and more — all of which influence the final wine quality.


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical computation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML model building


## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models

Three classification models were trained and tested:

| Model                     | Accuracy |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Random Forest Classifier | 69%      |
| SGD Classifier           | 59%      |
| Support Vector Classifier| 66%      |


## 📌 Project Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Visualize feature relationships (EDA)
4. Train ML models
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Save the best model as a `.pkl` file for deployment
